Hi, I'm Erica. I'm a postdoctoral scholar at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), currently working to apply the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) to assess marine biodiveristy and food provisioning in the Gulf of California, Mexico.

My research is interdisciplinary, broadly focused on the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, ‘fish’, and fisheries in the temperate and subtropical regions of the United States and Latin America. Through my work, I seek to develop conservation solutions by indentifying the social-ecological factors that are within our control and could – theoretically – be adapted to enhance marine and coastal resilience in the face of <i>multiple</i> climate-change stressors. To accomplish my work, I draw heavily on lessons from the fields of marine ecology and ecophysiology, marine policy and management, oceanography, and Earth Systems science.

Prior to joining NCEAS, I was a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Coastal Sustainability Lab](https://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/) at UC Santa Cruz. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Marine Biology and M.S. in Oceanography at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Aburto Lab](https://www.aburtolab.org/). At Scripps, I received formal training in global policy and strategy via the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation's [Program for Interdisciplinary Environmental Research](https://cmbc.ucsd.edu/program-for-interdisciplinary-environmental-research-pier-phd-specialization/). 

I passionate about the work that I do and believe that our efforts to build a more just, sustainable future will require ambition, clarity of vision, and a willingness to work together across fields and in good faith. For this reason, I also make a point to dedicate energy to important outreach, teaching, and service iniatives.

When I'm not at work, I like to spend time at the beach, in the ocean, at the zoo, and with friends!

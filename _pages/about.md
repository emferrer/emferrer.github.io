Hi, I'm Erica. I'm a postdoctoral scholar at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), currently working to apply the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) framework to assess ocean health and ecosystem services in the Gulf of California, Mexico.

My research is interdisciplinary and broadly focused on the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, ‘fish’, and fisheries, with a special focus on subtropical and temperate systems in the United States and Latin America. Through my research, I seek to advance conservation solutions to marine multiple-stressor issues, and I am particularly interested in elucidating the social-ecological factors within our control that confer resilience. To accomplish my work, I draw heavily on lessons from the fields of marine ecology and ecophysiology, marine policy and environmental management, biological oceanography, and Earth Systems science.

Prior to joining NCEAS, I was a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Coastal Sustainability Lab](https://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/) at UC Santa Cruz. (You can learn more about the Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship, supported under the UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, [here](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/).) And before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Marine Biology and M.S. in Oceanography at UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Aburto Lab](https://www.aburtolab.org/).

When I'm not at work, I like to spend my time at the beach, in the ocean and on SCUBA, at the zoo, and with friends.

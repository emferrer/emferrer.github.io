Hi, I'm Erica, and I'm postdoctoral scholar in the [Halpern Research Group](http://www.benhalpernresearch.org/research) at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). At NCEAS, I am working to apply the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) to evaluate marine biodiversity and food provisioning in the Gulf of California, Mexico, with the goal of informing science-based conservation and management.

My research is inherently interdisciplinary, centered around understanding the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, ‘fish’, and fisheries in the temperate and subtropical regions of the United States and Latin America. I am particularly interested in understanding the impacts of ocean warming and deoxygenation on nearshore ecosystems, invertebrate taxa, and fishery species that can be used for mariculture.

Through my work, I seek to develop conservation solutions by identifying social-ecological factors that are within our control and can be adapted to enhance marine and coastal resilience in the face of multiple climate change stressors. To accomplish my work, I draw heavily on lessons from the fields of marine ecology and ecophysiology, coastal policy and management, oceanography, and Earth systems science.

Prior to joining NCEAS, I was a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Coastal Sustainability Lab](https://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/) at UC Santa Cruz. I earned my Ph.D. in Marine Biology and M.S. in Oceanography at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Aburto Lab](https://www.aburtolab.org/) in 2023, where I also received formal training in global policy and strategy through the Scripps Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation's [Program for Interdisciplinary Environmental Research](https://cmbc.ucsd.edu/program-for-interdisciplinary-environmental-research-pier-phd-specialization/). 

I am passionate about the work that I do and believe that our efforts to build a more just, sustainable future will require ambition, clarity of vision, and a willingness to work together across fields and in good faith. As part of this commitment, I dedicate part of my time as a scientist to important outreach, teaching, community-building, and service initiatives.

Outside of work, I like to spend time at the beach, in the ocean, at the zoo, and with friends!

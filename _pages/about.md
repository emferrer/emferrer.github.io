Hi, I'm Erica. I'm a postdoctoral scholar at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), currently working to apply the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) framework to assess ocean health and ecosystem services in the Gulf of California, Mexico.

Prior to joining NCEAS, I was a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Coastal Sustainability Lab](https://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/) at UC Santa Cruz. (You can learn more about the Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship, supported under the UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, [here](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/).) Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Marine Biology and M.S. in Oceanography at UC San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Aburto Lab](https://www.aburtolab.org/) (August, 2023).

My research is broadly focused on the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems, ‘fish’, and fisheries, with a special focus on subtropical and temperate systems in the United States and Latin America. Through my research, I seek to advance solutions to marine conservation issues, and I am particularly interested in understanding the oceanographic trends and social-ecological factors that confer resilience. To accomplish my work, I draw heavily on lessons from the fields of marine ecology and ecophysiology, oceanography, Earth Systems science, and environmental sustainability.

When I'm not at work, I like to spend my time at the beach, in the ocean, at the zoo, and with friends!

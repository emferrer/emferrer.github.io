Hi, I'm Erica. I'm a postdoctoral scholar at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), currently working to apply the [Ocean Health Index](https://oceanhealthindex.org/) framework to assess marine health, biodiveristy, and food provisioning in the Gulf of California, Mexico.

My research is interdisciplinary – broadly focused on the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, ‘fish’, and fisheries in the temperate and subtropical regions of the United States and Latin America. Through my work, I seek to develop conservation solutions for marine systems by indentifying the social-ecological factors that are within our control and could – theoretically – be managed to enhance coastal resilience in the face of <i>multiple</i> emerging climate stressors. To accomplish my work, I draw heavily on lessons from the fields of marine ecology and ecophysiology, marine policy and management, oceanography, and Earth Systems science.

Prior to joining NCEAS, I was a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Coastal Sustainability Lab](https://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/) at UC Santa Cruz. (You can learn more about the Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship, supported under the University of California's President's PFP, [here](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/).)

I completed my Ph.D. in Marine Biology and M.S. in Oceanography at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the [Aburto Lab](https://www.aburtolab.org/). While at Scripps, I also received formal interdisciplinary training, with a focus on global policy and strategy, via the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation's [Program for Interdisciplinary Environmental Research](https://cmbc.ucsd.edu/program-for-interdisciplinary-environmental-research-pier-phd-specialization/).

When I'm not at work, I like to spend my time at the beach, in the ocean, at the zoo, and with friends!
